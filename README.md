# Auth0 React SDK Sample Application

This is a sample app showing how to integrate Auth0 React SDK into a SPA using the create-react-app.

Remember to install the needed dependencies - use npm install

_This sample was derived from the Auth0 React SDK Quickstart which can be found here https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react_

SPA includes:
login button (components)
logout button (components)
Auth0 widget + social sign-in

added extensions used:
userlinking for social profiles 

added rules in Auth0:
email verification for sign-on (forced)
welcome email 

**How to deploy and use: **

1) Have an app created in Auth0 and navigate to Settings
2) Scrolldown to callback URLs Logout URLs, and Allowed Web Origins - replace all URLs with http://localhost:3000
3) Navigate to your project directly and install the Auth0 React SDK using 'npm install @auth0/auth0-react' & Save
4) In your editor, create a new .env file in the directory folder and input these two lines of code: 

REACT_APP_AUTH0_DOMAIN=Client id
REACT_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=Domain

These two keys are found in the 'settings' section of the Auth0 app

#More about create react-app 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
